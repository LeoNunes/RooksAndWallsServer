# Keep aws/README.md in Sync

Whenever you modify any file under `aws/` (scripts, nginx templates, service files), you **must** also update `aws/README.md` to reflect the change.

## What to update

- **CodeDeploy Hooks section** — if a script's responsibilities change (steps added, removed, or reordered)
- **Nginx Contract section** — if template files or `envsubst` variable substitutions change
- **appspec.yml Expectations** — if new files or directories need to be copied to the instance
- **Required Environment Files / Secrets Manager Contract** — if new env vars are read or validated
- **before_install.sh hook** — if new packages are installed

## What NOT to do

- Do not skip the README update even for "small" script changes — behavior drift between docs and scripts is the main failure mode.
- Do not describe *how* you changed the code in the README; describe the *current* behavior after the change.
